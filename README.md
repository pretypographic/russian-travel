# Project: Journey Through Russia

This educational project is focused on mastering responsive web design techniques. The work showcases the adaptive features of CSS, ensuring the site is displayed optimally across a range of devices, from wide-screen monitors to smartphone screens.

During the project development, I explored the capabilities of flexbox and grid layout, applied calculated and relative units, and aimed to use various methods to organize the website's internal architecture.

The project is structured according to the BEM methodology with a Nested file structure.

The main page introduces popular tourist destinations in Russia and contains links to reference information and useful travel tools (maps, flight schedules, etc.).
